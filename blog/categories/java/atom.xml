    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In an unreleased version of Couchbase Lite for Android, I was seeing the following error:</p>

<p><code>
SQLiteConnectionPool The connection pool for database has been unable to grant a connection to thread
SQLiteConnectionPool(14004): Connections: 0 active, 1 idle, 0 available.
</code></p>

<h2>Here&rsquo;s what turned out to be happening</h2>

<p><img src="http://cl.ly/image/0H40001q3T1Q/android_sqlite_deadlock.png" alt="Diagram" /></p>

<ul>
<li>Create a single SQLiteDatabase object that is shared among all threads</li>
<li>WriterThread spawned</li>
<li>t0: WriterThread opens a transaction and inserts some data</li>
<li>t1: WriterThread spawns ReaderThread</li>
<li>t2: ReaderThread attempts to read some data</li>
<li>t3: WriterThread calls .join() on ReaderThread to wait for it to finish</li>
<li>Deadlock!</li>
</ul>


<h2>Digging into the deadlock</h2>

<ul>
<li>WriterThread has an open transaction, and therefore is holding on to the one and only connection owned by the single SQLiteDatabase object</li>
<li>ReaderThread is trying to get a new connection to execute its statement, but cannot because WriterThread is holding the only one available</li>
<li>WriterThread is waiting for ReaderThread to finish so it can finish it&rsquo;s transaction and release the connection.</li>
<li>Deadlock!</li>
</ul>


<h2>Code to reproduce the issue</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/couchbaselabs/android-sqlite-experiments/blob/master/AndroidSQLiteExperiments/src/main/java/com/couchbaselabs/droidsqliteexprmnts/experiments/ThreadsSingleConnectionDeadlock.java">ThreadsSingleConnectionDeadlock.java</a></p>

<h2>Fix Idea #1 &ndash; Don&rsquo;t make WriterThread join ReaderThread</h2>

<p>This is the somewhat naive and obvious fix.</p>

<p>In the case of this particular bug, it looks like the code can be reworked to avoid this problem altogether, and should end up with a cleaner design anyway.</p>

<h2>(Bad) Fix Idea #2 &ndash; Each thread gets its own SQLiteDatabase object (for the same database)</h2>

<p>You would think this could solve the problem, and it probably would, but there are some major caveats here.</p>

<p>As explained in <a href="http://touchlabblog.tumblr.com/post/24474398246/android-sqlite-locking">Android Sqlite Locking</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>If you try to write to the database from actual distinct connections at the same time, one will fail.  It will not wait till the first is done and then write.  It will simply not write your change.  Worse, if you don’t call the right version of insert/update on the SQLiteDatabase, you won’t get an exception.  You’ll just get a message in your LogCat, and that will be it.</p></blockquote>

<p>So to avoid this kind of hellish scenario, it&rsquo;s definitely safer to stick with a <a href="http://touchlabblog.tumblr.com/post/24474750219/single-sqlite-connection">Single SQLite connection</a></p>

<h2>Is there really a good fix?</h2>

<p>So what if you absolutely needed to have the ability to have WriterThread join ReaderThread, and you wanted to avoid giving each thread it&rsquo;s own SQLiteDatabase object, how could that be accomplished?</p>

<p>Or is that just a silly scenario and it&rsquo;s better to just not do that?  (it seems fairly easy to do it by accident in any scenarios where threads are waiting on another and both accessing the same database)</p>

<p>Actually, I don&rsquo;t know &mdash; it&rsquo;s an open question.  Comments welcome.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Write a server that uses tcp sockets which returns images to clients, and avoids duplicate work for concurrent requests for the same image.</p>

<h1>Description</h1>

<p>A server will listen for tcp client connections and generate PNG checkerboard images and return them to clients that request them.  Example checkerboard image:</p>

<p><img src="/images/checkerboard.png" width="295" height="105" title="&lsquo;image&rsquo; &lsquo;images&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>The client will send a single parameter to the server after it opens the tcp socket connection to the server:</p>

<ul>
<li> The size of the &ldquo;checkboard image&rdquo;, which will be a single scalar value like 5, which will result in a 5x5 square, as shown above.</li>
</ul>


<p>The server will use the following default values when generating the checkerboard image:</p>

<ul>
<li> size: each square will be 60 x 60 pixels.</li>
<li> color: squares will be alternating black and white, with black for the square in the 0th row and 0th column, and white for the square in the 1st row and 0th column, etc.  Exactly as shown above.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Basic Requirements</h1>

<ul>
<li>Written in either Java or Scala</li>
<li>To generate the actual image, you can use anything you want.  The image format can be any popular image format (PNG, JPEG, GIF, etc..)</li>
<li>For the data structures required by the server, you can use any existing data structures within Java itself or a 3rd party, there is no requirement to develop your own.</li>
<li>The server will respond with the image data in PNG format, and then close the connection.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Advanced Requirements</h1>

<ul>
<li>In the method that generates the square, there must be a call to Thread.sleep(Y) before returning.  Y represents number of milliseconds to sleep, and will be a random number between 0 and 5000.</li>
<li>The server can handle multiple client requests in parallel (as opposed to handling them in serial).  In other words, if client1 contacts the server, and then client2 contacts the server a few milliseconds later, there is a chance that client2 will receive a response before client1, depending on the random sleep described above.</li>
<li>In order to avoid needlessly generating the same image twice, if the server is asked to generate a square of size X by client1, and then again asked to generate another square of size X by client2 before it has returned the square to client1, it will simply wait for the square for client1 is finished being generated and return that same square data to both client2 and client1.  Here is an example timeline to show how events would roughly be ordered:

<ul>
<li>At 12:00:00 Client1 asks for square of size 6</li>
<li>At 12:00:01 The server starts to generate the square for client1</li>
<li>At 12:00:01 Client2 asks for square of size 6 (the server does <em>not</em> try to generate a new square, since there is already a pending request for an identical square)</li>
<li>At 12:00:06 The server finishes generating the square of size 6, as originally requested by client1</li>
<li>At 12:00:07 The server returns the square to client1</li>
<li>At 12:00:07 The server returns the same square to client2</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h1>Deliverables</h1>

<ul>
<li>server.sh &ndash; starts the server that listens on 8000</li>
<li>client.sh X &ndash; runs a client that:

<ul>
<li>connects to localhost:8000</li>
<li>passes the parameter X (the size of the checkboard image) to the server</li>
<li>reads the PNG into a file called X.png</li>
<li>prints a message to say its finished.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A zip file that contains all jar file dependencies <em>or</em> a document that describes on how to download the required dependencies</li>
</ul>


<h1>Shortcuts</h1>

<p>If this feels like too much work, take the following shortcut:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rather than return an image, just create a string which would represent the image, where X represents black and O represents white.  Eg, if it was a 2x2 square, return &ldquo;X00X&rdquo;</li>
</ul>


<h1>Bonus points</h1>

<ul>
<li>Record your commits in a local git repository as you work, and submit a zip file of the repository along with the other deliverables</li>
</ul>
