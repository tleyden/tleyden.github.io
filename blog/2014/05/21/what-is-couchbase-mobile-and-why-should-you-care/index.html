<div class="entry-content"><p>Couchbase Mobile just announced it&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.couchbase.com/press-releases/couchbase-mobile-enables-new-breed-network-independent-mobile-applications">1.0 release</a> today.</p>

<p>What is Couchbase Mobile?</p>

<ul>
<li>Couchbase Lite is an open source iOS/Android NoSQL DB with built-in sync capability.</li>
<li>Couchbase Mobile refers to the &ldquo;full stack&rdquo; solution, which includes the (also open source) server components that Couchbase Lite uses for sync.</li>
</ul>


<p>To give a deeper look at what problem Couchbase Mobile is meant to solve, let me tell you the story of how I came to discover Couchbase Lite as a developer.  In my <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/26/signature-launches-to-bring-a-personalized-mobile-shopping-service-to-brick-and-mortar-retailers/">previous startup</a>, we built a mobile CRM app for sales associates.</p>

<p>The very first pilot release of the app, the initial architecture was:</p>

<p><img src="http://tleyden-misc.s3.amazonaws.com/blog_images/architecture_1.png" alt="screenshot" /></p>

<p>It was very simple, and the server was almost the Single Point of Truth, except for our JSON caching layer which had a very short expiry time before it would refetch from the server.  The biggest downside to this architecture was that <em>it only worked well when the device had a fast connection to the internet</em>.</p>

<p>But there was another problem: getting updates to sync across devices in a timely manner.   When sales associate #1 would update a customer, sales associate #2 wouldn&rsquo;t see the change because:</p>

<ul>
<li>How does the app for sales associate #2 know it needs to &ldquo;re-sync&rdquo; the data?</li>
<li>How will the app know that something changed on the backend that should cause it to invalidate that locally cached data?</li>
</ul>


<p>We realized that the data sync between the devices was going to be a huge issue going forward, and so we decided to change our architecture to something like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://tleyden-misc.s3.amazonaws.com/blog_images/architecture_2.png" alt="screenshot" /></p>

<p>So the app would be displaying what&rsquo;s stored in the Core Data datastore, and we&rsquo;d build a <em>sync engine</em> component that would shuttle data bidirectionally between Core Data and the backend server.</p>

<p>That seemed like a fine idea on paper, except that I refused to build it.  I knew it would take way too long to build, and once it was built it probably would entail endless debugging and tuning.</p>

<p>Instead, after some intense debate we embarked on a furious sprint to convert everything over to <a href="https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-lite-ios">Couchbase Lite iOS</a>.  We ended up with an architecture like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://tleyden-misc.s3.amazonaws.com/blog_images/architecture%203.png" alt="screenshot" /></p>

<p>It was similar in spirit to our original plans, except <strong>we didn&rsquo;t have to build any of the hard stuff</strong> &mdash; the storage engine and the sync was already taken care of for us by Couchbase Lite.</p>

<p>(<em>note</em>: there were also components that listened for changes to the backend server database and fired off emails and push notifications, but I&rsquo;m not showing them here)</p>

<p>After the conversion ..</p>

<p><strong>On the upside</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Any updates to customer data would quickly sync across all devices.</li>
<li>Our app still worked even when the device was completely offline.</li>
<li>Our app was orders of magnituted faster in &ldquo;barely connected&rdquo; scenarios, because Couchbase Lite <em>takes the network out of the critical path</em>.</li>
<li>Our data was now &ldquo;document oriented&rdquo;, and so we could worry less about rolling out schema changes while having several different versions of our app out in the wild.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>On the downside</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>We ran into a few bizarre situations where a client app would <em>regurgitate</em> a ton of unwanted data back into the system after we&rsquo;d thought we&rsquo;d removed it.  To be fair, that was our fault, but I mention it because Couchbase Lite can throw you some curve balls if you aren&rsquo;t paying attention.</li>
<li>Certain things were awkward.  For example for our initial login experience, we had to sync the data before the sales associate could login.  We ended up re-working that to have the login go directly against the server, which meant that logging in required the user to be online.</li>
<li>When things went wrong, they were a bit complicated to debug.  (but because Couchbase Lite is Open Source, we could diagnose and fix bugs ourselves, which was a huge win.)</li>
</ul>


<h1>So what can Couchbase Lite do for you?</h1>

<h2>Sync Engine included, so you don&rsquo;t have to build one</h2>

<p>If I had to sum up one quick elevator pitch of Couchbase Lite, it would be:</p>

<blockquote><p>If you find that you&rsquo;re building a &ldquo;sync engine&rdquo; to sync data from your app to other instances of your app and/or the cloud, then you should probably be building it on top of Couchbase Lite instead of going down that rabbit hole &mdash; since you may never make it back out.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Your app now works well in offline or occasionally connected scenarios</h2>

<p>This is something that users expect your app to handle.  For example, if I&rsquo;m on the BART going from SF &ndash;> Oakland and have no signal, I should still be able to read my tweets, and even send new tweets that will be queued to sync once the device comes back online.</p>

<p>If your app is based on Couchbase Lite, you essentially get these features for free.</p>

<ul>
<li>When you load tweets, it is loaded from the local Couchbase Lite store, without any need to hit the server.</li>
<li>When you create a new tweet, you just save it to Couchbase Lite, and let it handle the heavy lifting of getting that pushed up to the server once the device is back online.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Your data model is now Document Oriented</h2>

<p>This is a double edged sword, and to be perfectly honest a Document Oriented approach is not always the ideal data model for every application.  However, for some applications (like CRM), it&rsquo;s a much more natural fit than the relational model.</p>

<p>And you&rsquo;ll never have to worry about getting yourself stuck in Core Data schema migration hell.</p>

<h1>What&rsquo;s the dark side of Couchbase Lite?</h1>

<h2>Queries can be faster, but they have certain limitations</h2>

<p>With SQL, you can run arbitrary queries, irregardless if there is an index or not.</p>

<p>Couchbase Lite cannot be queried with SQL.  Instead you must define <em>Views</em>, which are essentially indexes, and run queries on those views.  Views are extremely fast and efficient, but if you don&rsquo;t have a view, you can&rsquo;t run a query, period.</p>

<p>For people who are used to SQL, defining lower level map/reduce views takes some time to wrap your head around.</p>

<h2>Complex queries can get downright awkward</h2>

<p>Views are powerful, but they have their limitations, and if your query is complex enough, you may end up needing to write multiple views and coalescing/sorting the data in memory.</p>

<h2>It&rsquo;s not a black box, but it <em>is</em> complicated.</h2>

<p>The replication code in Couchbase Lite is complicated.  I know, because I&rsquo;ve spent a better part of the last year staring at it.</p>

<p>As an app developer, you are putting your trust that the replication will work as you would expect and that it will be performant and easy on the battery.</p>

<p><strong>The good news</strong> is that it&rsquo;s 100% open source under the Apache 2 license.  So you can debug into it, send issues and pull requests to our <a href="https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-lite-android">github repo</a>, and even maintain your own fork if needed.</p>
