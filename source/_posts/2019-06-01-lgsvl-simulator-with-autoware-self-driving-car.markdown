## System

* Ubuntu 18 with Desktop/X-windows access

## Install Unity

This will take the approach of doing a full Unity install and then building the simulator from source and running from the Unity editor.

### Install Unity Hub

```
$ wget https://public-cdn.cloud.unity3d.com/hub/prod/UnityHubSetup.AppImage
$ chmod +x UnityHubSetup.AppImage
```

In the File manager double-click the `UnityHubSetup.AppImage` and agree to the license and setup the desktop links.  From now on, you can open it from your Applications.

### Install Unity 2018.2.x

* In Unity Hub, click "Add".
* Choose the latest 2018.2.x release (eg, 2018.2.21f1)
