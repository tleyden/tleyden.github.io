Joyent has recently announced their new Triton Docker container hosting service.  There are several advantages of running Docker containers on Triton over a more traditional cloud hosting platform:

* Better performance since there is no hardware level virtualization overhead.  Your containers run on bare-metal.

* Simplified networking between containers.  Each container gets its own private (and optionally public) ip address.

* Hosts are abstracted away -- you just deploy into the "container cloud", and don't care which host your container is running on.

For more details, check out Bryan Cantrill's talk about [Docker and the Future of Containers in Production](https://www.joyent.com/developers/videos/docker-and-the-future-of-containers-in-production).

Let's give it a spin with a "hello world" container, and then with a cluster of Couchbase servers.

## Sign up for a Joyent account

[Follow the signup instructions on the Joyent website](https://www.joyent.com/lp/preview)

You will also need to add your SSH key to your account.

## Install or Upgrade Docker

If you don't have Docker installed already and you are on Ubuntu, run:

```
$ curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh
```

See [install Docker on Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/) for more details.

## Upgrade Docker client to 1.4.1 or later

Check your version of Docker with:

```
$ docker --version
Docker version 1.0.1, build 990021a
```

If you are on a version before 1.4.1 (like I was), you can upgrade Docker via the [boot2docker installers](https://github.com/boot2docker/osx-installer/releases).

## Joyent + Docker setup

Get the sdc-docker repo (sdc == Smart Data Center): 

```
$ git clone https://github.com/joyent/sdc-docker.git
```

Perform setup via:

```
$ cd sdc-docker
$  ./tools/sdc-docker-setup.sh -k 165.225.168.22 $ACCOUNT ~/.ssh/$PRIVATE_KEY_FILE
```

Replace values as follows:

* **$ACCOUNT**: you can get this by logging into the Joyent web ui and going to the Account menu from the pulldown in the top-right corner.  Find the **Username** field, and use that 
* **$PRIVATE_KEY_FILE**: the name of the file where your private key is stored, typically this will be `id_rsa`

Run the command and you should see the following output:

```
Setting up Docker client for SDC using:
    CloudAPI:        https://165.225.168.22
    Account:         <your username>
    Key:             /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa

[..snip..]

Wrote certificate files to /home/ubuntu/.sdc/docker/<username>

Docker service endpoint is: tcp://<generated ip>:2376

* * *
Success. Set your environment as follows:

    export DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/home/ubuntu/.sdc/docker/<username>
    export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://<generated-ip>:2376
    alias docker="docker --tls"

Then you should be able to run 'docker info' and see your account
name 'SDCAccount: <username>' in the output.
```

**Export environment variables**

As the output above suggests, copy and paste the commands from the output.  Here's an example of what that will look like (but you should copy and paste from your command output, not the snippet below):

```
$ export DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/home/ubuntu/.sdc/docker/<username>
$ export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://<generated-ip>:2376
$ alias docker="docker --tls"
```

## Docker Hello World

Let's spin up an Ubuntu docker image that says hello world.

Remember you're running the Docker client on your workstation, not in the cloud.  Here's an overview on what's going to be happening:

![diagram](http://tleyden-misc.s3.amazonaws.com/blog_images/joyent_container_hello_world.png)

To start the docker container::

```
$ docker run --rm ubuntu:14.04 echo "Hello Docker World, from Joyent"
```

You should see the following output:

```
Unable to find image 'ubuntu:14.04' locally
Pulling repository library/ubuntu
...
Hello Docker World, from Joyent
```

Also, since the `--rm` flag was passed, the container will have been removed after exiting.  You can verify this by running `docker ps -a`.  This is important because **stopped containers incur charges on Joyent**.  

Congratulations!  You've gotten a "hello world" Docker container running on Joyent.

## Run Couchbase Server containers

Now it's time to run Couchbase Server.

To kick off three Couchbase Server containers, run:

```
$ for i in `seq 1 3`; do \
      echo "Starting container $i"; \
      export container_$i=$(docker run --name couchbase-server-$i -d -P couchbase/server); \
  done
```

To confirm the containers are up, run:

```
$ docker ps
```

and you should see:

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                       COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
5bea8901814c        couchbase/server   "couchbase-start"   3 minutes ago       Up 2 minutes                            couchbase-server-1
bef1f2f32726        couchbase/server   "couchbase-start"   2 minutes ago       Up 2 minutes                            couchbase-server-2
6f4e2a1e8e63        couchbase/server   "couchbase-start"   2 minutes ago       Up About a minute                       couchbase-server-3
```

At this point you will have environment variables defined with the container ids of each container.  You can check this by running:

```
$ echo $container_1 && echo $container_2 && echo $container_3
21264e44d66b4004b4828b7ae408979e7f71924aadab435aa9de662024a37b0e
ff9fb4db7b304e769f694802e6a072656825aa2059604ba4ab4d579bd2e5d18d
0c6f8ca2951448e497d7e12026dcae4aeaf990ec51e047cf9d8b2cbdd9bd7668
```

### Get public ip addresses of the containers

Each container will have two IP addresses assigned:

* A public IP, accessible from anywhere 
* A private IP, only accessible from containers/machines in your Joyent account

To get the public IP, we can use the Docker client.  (to get the private IP, you need to use the Joyent SmartDataCenter tools, which is described below)

```
$ container_1_ip=`docker inspect $container_1 | grep -i IPAddress | awk -F: '{print $2}' |  grep -oE "\b([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}\b"`
$ container_2_ip=`docker inspect $container_2 | grep -i IPAddress | awk -F: '{print $2}' |  grep -oE "\b([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}\b"`
$ container_3_ip=`docker inspect $container_3 | grep -i IPAddress | awk -F: '{print $2}' |  grep -oE "\b([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}\b"`

```

You will now have the public IP addresses of each container defined in environment variables.  You can check that it worked via:

```
$ echo $container_1_ip && echo $container_2_ip && echo $container_3_ip
165.225.185.11
165.225.185.12
165.225.185.13
```

### Connect to Couchbase Web UI

Open your browser to $container_1_ip:8091 and you should see:

![Couchbase Welcome Screen](http://tleyden-misc.s3.amazonaws.com/blog_images/couchbase_cluster_setup.png)

At this point, it's possible to setup the cluster by going to each Couchbase node's Web UI and following the Setup Wizard.  However, in case you want to automate this in the future, let's do this over the command line instead.

### Setup first Couchbase node

Let's arbitrarily pick **container_1** as the first node in the cluster.  This node is special in the sense that other nodes will join it.

The following command will do the following:

* Set the Administrator's username and password to Administrator / password (you should change this)
* Set the cluster RAM size to 600 MB 

Note: the `-u admin -p password` should be left as-is, since that is just passing in the default admin name and password for auth purposes.

```
$ docker run --rm --entrypoint=/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli couchbase/server \
cluster-init -c $container_1_ip \
--cluster-init-username=Administrator \
--cluster-init-password=password \
--cluster-init-ramsize=600 \
-u admin -p password
```

You should see a response like:

```
SUCCESS: init 165.225.185.11
```

### Create a default bucket

A bucket is equivalent to a database in typical RDMS systems.  

```
$ docker run --rm --entrypoint=/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli couchbase/server \
bucket-create -c $container_1_ip:8091 \
--bucket=default \
--bucket-type=couchbase \
--bucket-port=11211 \
--bucket-ramsize=600 \
--bucket-replica=1 \
-u Administrator -p password
```

You should see:

```
SUCCESS: bucket-create
```

### Add 2nd Couchbase node

Add in the second Couchbase node with this command

```
$ docker run --rm --entrypoint=/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli couchbase/server \
server-add -c $container_1_ip \
-u Administrator -p password \
--server-add $container_2_ip \
--server-add-username Administrator \
--server-add-password password 
```

You should see:

```
SUCCESS: server-add 165.225.185.12:8091
```

To verify it was added, run:

```
$ docker run --rm --entrypoint=/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli couchbase/server \
server-list -c $container_1_ip \
-u Administrator -p password
```

which should return the list of Couchbase Server nodes that are now part of the cluster:

```
ns_1@165.225.185.11 165.225.185.11:8091 healthy active
ns_1@165.225.185.12 165.225.185.12:8091 healthy inactiveAdded
```

### Add 3rd Couchbase node and rebalance

In this step we will:

* Add the 3rd Couchbase node
* Trigger a "rebalance", which distributes the (empty) bucket's data across the cluster

```
$ docker run --rm --entrypoint=/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli couchbase/server \
rebalance -c $container_1_ip \
-u Administrator -p password \
--server-add $container_3_ip \
--server-add-username Administrator \
--server-add-password password 
```

You should see:

```
INFO: rebalancing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
SUCCESS: rebalanced cluster
close failed in file object destructor:
Error in sys.excepthook:

Original exception was:
```

If you see **SUCCESS**, then it worked.  *(I'm not sure why the "close failed in file .." error is happening, but so far it appears that it can be safely ignored.)*

### Login to Web UI

Open your browser to $container_1_ip:8091 and you should see:

![Couchbase Login Screen](http://tleyden-misc.s3.amazonaws.com/blog_images/couchbase_cluster_login.png)

Login with:

* Username: **Administrator**
* Password: **password**

And you should see:

![Couchbase Nodes](http://tleyden-misc.s3.amazonaws.com/blog_images/couchbase_cluster_nodes.png)

Congratulations!  You have a Couchbase Server cluster up and running on Joyent Triton.

## Teardown

To stop and remove your Couchbase server containers, run:

```
$ docker stop $container_1 $container_2 $container_3
$ docker rm $container_1 $container_2 $container_3
```

To double check that you no longer have any containers running or in the stopped state, run `docker ps -a` and you should see an empty list.

## Installing the SDC tools (optional)

Installing the Joyent Smart Data Center (SDC) tools will allow you to gain more visibility into your container cluster -- for example being able to view the internal IP of each continer.

Here's how to install the sdc-tools suite.

### Install smartdc

First [install NodeJS + NPM](http://coolestguidesontheplanet.com/installing-node-js-on-osx-10-10-yosemite/)

Install smartdc:

```
npm install -g smartdc
```

### Configure environment variables

```
$ export SDC_URL=https://us-east-3b.api.joyent.com
$ export SDC_ACCOUNT=<ACCOUNT>
$ export SDC_KEY_ID=$(ssh-keygen -l -f $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | awk '{print $2}')
```

Replace values as follows:

* **ACCOUNT**: you can get this by logging into the Joyent web ui and going to the Account menu from the pulldown in the top-right corner.  Find the **Username** field, and use that 

### List machines

Run `sdc-listmachines` to list all the containers running under your Joyent account.  Your output should look something like this:

```
$ sdc-listmachines
[
{
    "id": "0c6f8ca2-9514-48e4-97d7-e12026dcae4a",
    "name": "couchbase-server-3",

    ],
    "dataset": "335a8046-0749-1174-5666-6f084472b5ef",

    "package": "t4-standard-1G"
  },
]
```

### Find private IP of an individual machine

```
$ sdc-getmachine <machine_id> | json -aH ips | json -aH | egrep "10\.|192\.”
```
